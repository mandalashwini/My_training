sudo allows a permitted user to execute a command as another user, according to specifications in the /etc/sudoers file. The real and effective uid and gid of the issuing user are then set to match those of the target user account as specified in the passwd file.
By default, sudo requires that users authenticate themselves with a password. By default this is the user's password, not the root password itself.
Once a user has been authenticated, a timestamp is recorded and the user may use sudo without a password for a short period of time (5 minutes, unless configured differently in sudoers). This timestamp can be renewed if the user issues sudo with the -v flag.
If a user not listed in sudoers tries to run a command using sudo, it is considered an unsuccessful attempt to breach system security and mail is sent to the proper authorities, as defined at configure time or in the sudoers file. The default authority to be notified of unsuccessful sudo attempts is root. Note that the mail will not be sent if an unauthorized user tries to run sudo with the -l or -v flags; this allows users to determine for themselves whether or not they are allowed to use sudo.
sudo can log both successful and unsuccessful attempts (as well as errors) to syslog, a unique log file, or both. By default sudo will log to syslog but this can be changed at configure time or in the sudoers file.
